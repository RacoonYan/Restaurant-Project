Individual Project of Hyperisland. An award winning Chinese restaurant from the UK wants to open their first flagship restaurant in the US, with the goal of attracting a large customer base to build a foundation for future endeavors. The owners always had the goal to offer an authentic experience at an affordable price point, while keeping the quality high. This means they are not mainly interested in opening up in metropolitan areas.The goal of this project is to find candidates for promising locations in the US for their first branch.
